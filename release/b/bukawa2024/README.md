Bukawa2024 keyboard
==============

Description
-----------
This is a replacement for a previous Keyman keyboard for Bukawa.

The Bukawa special characters are initiated using the deadkey ‘[‘
While the special characters could have been assigned to letters such as 'j' or 'q' that are not used in Bukawa, the use of a deadkey means that both Bukawa and English text can be typed without having to change keyboards.

The following are the key combinations that result in the special characters for Bukawa:

[ + j > ŋ
[ + n > ŋ

[ + J > Ŋ
[ + N > Ŋ

[ + e > ê

[ + E > Ê

[ + o > ô

[ + O > Ô

[ + q > ö

[ + Q > Ö

[ + h > ́  (high tone on vowels)*

[ + l > ̀̀  (low tone on vowels)*

* NOTE: to add a tone marker to a vowel,  key in the marker first (eg [ + h or OPT + h) then the vowel. With most Unicode fonts the tone marker will distinguish between normal vowels and vowels with the circumflex marker or umlaut and position itself appropriately.

Note also that if the user wants to key the square bracket itself then keying it twice overrides the deadkey function and pruduces a square bracket. (i.e. [ + [ > [ )
